            <p> Tokyo, officially Tokyo Metropolis, is the capital of Japan and one of its 47 prefectures. The Greater
                Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world. It is the seat of the Emperor of Japan
                and the Japanese government. </p>
            <p>Tokyo is in the Kanto region on the southeastern side of the main island Honshu and includes the Izu
                Islands and Ogasawara Islands. Formerly known as Edo, it has been the de facto seat of government
                since 1603 when Shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Tokyo officially became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from the old
        capital of Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from
        the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture and the city of Tokyo.
